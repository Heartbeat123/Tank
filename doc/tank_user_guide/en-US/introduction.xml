  <para>Intuit Tank is a load test platform that runs in a cloud environment. It currently supports Amazon web
    interfaces and utilizes services from EC2, S3 and DynamoDb.</para>

  <para>Intuit Tank has two main components: A controller and agents.</para>

  <para>The Controller is the central hub in the deployment. It supports the GUI for managing tests and for
    orchestrating. It utilizes Tomcat for a web container and ActiveMQ as a message queue for communication. It exposes
    a
    RESTful interface for invoking services. It stores data in a sql database, and uses a s3 bucket as a shared filesystem.
    It can be accessed at the context root of http://[baseUrlOfAmazonInstance]/tank</para>

  <para>Agents are instantiated on demand and exist for the duration of a test. They communicate with the
    controller via a combination of RESTful interfaces as well as the Message Queue.</para>

  <para>The Controller also interfaces with an instance of a JMS Queue (ActiveMQ), usually on the same instance as
    the controller. The Message Queue is used to coordinate starting and coordination of tests.</para>

  <para>Optional components can include a log aggregator as well as other instances to be started at the beginning
    of a test. These are configured in the settings.xml and can be stopped and re-used or terminated at the end of a test.
  </para>
