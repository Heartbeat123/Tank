  <para>The purpose of this guide is to describe the IT concepts and strategies employed by Intuit Tank.</para>

  <para>Intuit Tank is meant to be an integrated testing solution for driving load against production systems. It
    includes a central controller for coordinating test agents and driving the UI for setting up and reporting on the
    tests. THe agents are instantiated on demand and terminated when they are no longer needed. This helps keep the
    costs of running large tests to a minimum.</para>

  <para>Intuit Tank is meant to be a load test solution and is not currently optimized for functional testing. This does
    not mean that it is not useful for functional testing, but many of the functional testing paradigms and tools may be lacking.
